Don't waste food!

## Inspiration
During the holiday season and even during other times, we see that a lot of food is generally wasted from events, parties and get-togethers. This wasted food, instead of going to a landfill can be used to feed someone for example:
- Homeless people
- Orphanages
- Homeless Shelters

## What it does
Hungry Turkey has 2 modes. 1 for donating food and 1 for requesting food.   
If you have extra food after an event, you can register on the Hungry Turkey app and specify
- The location
- What food there is
- Approximately how many servings

Anyone who wants to request food and see the list and contact the donor to arrange a pick up for the food.

## How we built it
The technology used is:
- Node.js for the application
- Cockroach DB for the database
- Google Cloud Platform for hosting the database

## Challenges we ran into
- Getting the Cockroach DB single node cluster set up

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Learned something new!

## What we learned
Working with Node.js, Cockraoch DB and Google Cloud Platform

## What's next for Hungry Turkey
- Make a GUI website/mobile app to make it easy to use
- Add a picture of the food
- Add contact methods through the app
